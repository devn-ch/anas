# Tests for packaging/anas-md-event.sh (story 11.17): the RebuildFinished
# bad-block check + scrub recommendation. The real hook runs against a faked
# sysfs tree (ANAS_MD_SYSFS_BLOCK) with `logger` and `perl` shimmed onto PATH
# to capture what would hit journald and PVE::Notify — no mdadm, no root.
#
# Covers:
#   1. RebuildFinished + recorded bad blocks -> BADBLOCKS=N in the journald
#      line, WARNING severity, pointed "identify affected files" advice.
#   2. RebuildFinished + clean BBL -> BADBLOCKS=0, info severity, "exact"
#      wording + precaution note.
#   3. RebuildFinished + unreadable sysfs -> no BADBLOCKS key, info severity,
#      generic precaution note (fail-open).
#   4. Other events (Fail) unchanged: no scrub note, warning severity.
#   5. Usage error still exits 64.
