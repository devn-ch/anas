# anas-md-event — mdadm --monitor PROGRAM hook for ANAS AHR pools.
#
# Installed by the ANAS installer as /usr/local/bin/anas-md-event and wired via
# a surgical `PROGRAM /usr/local/bin/anas-md-event` line in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
# (AHR-DESIGN §7.2, GT-11: mdmonitor runs out of the box on Debian — this hook
# makes its events land somewhere useful instead of root mail).
#
# Contract (mdadm.conf(5) / mdadm --monitor):
#   anas-md-event <event> <md-device> [<member-device>]
#     $1  event name (Fail, FailSpare, DegradedArray, RebuildFinished,
#         SparesMissing, RebuildStarted, Rebuild20, NewArray, SpareActive,
#         MoveSpare, DeviceDisappeared, TestMessage, ...)
#     $2  md device the event concerns (e.g. /dev/md127)
#     $3  member device, when the event concerns one (e.g. /dev/sdb2) — optional
#
# Output: one structured journald record via logger, tag `anas-ahr`, facility
# daemon, severity mapped from the event (AHR-DESIGN §7.2 table). Message body
# is key=value fields (EVENT= DEVICE= MEMBER=) per the journald audit
# conventions.
#
# Exit status: 0 after logging (never make mdadm's monitor loop unhappy);
# 64 (EX_USAGE) only when called without the mandatory <event> <md-device>.

# daemon, no socket and no node available; the logic cannot literally be shared,
# so the two MUST be kept in step. Change one, change the other.

# deliberately so: unreadable sysfs returns false, so a DegradedArray we cannot
# explain is still reported. Never silently swallow a degraded array.
