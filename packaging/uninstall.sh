# no longer exists, month after month; a lost schedule is the honest outcome of

# node (SCHEDULES-GROUND-TRUTH). Turning them back on is not a guess about what
# this node had before ANAS — it is restoring the distro default, which is what
# a guest leaves behind. The printed line says that is what happened, and how
# to turn them off again (spindown operators run without a periodic check on
# purpose).
