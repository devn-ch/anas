// Uniform snapshot schedules (Epic 17 — Schedules; docs/SCHEDULES-DESIGN.md).
//
// The guiding principle: ZFS and AHR function EXACTLY THE SAME with respect to
// snapshots, scrubbing, and pruning — one uniform user experience — even though
// the underlying mechanisms differ. A schedule targets either a ZFS dataset or
// an AHR pool; ANAS takes/prunes/lists snapshots through one policy and one set
// of shapes, dispatching to the filesystem-appropriate backend behind them.
//
// Stage 1 (this file) is the uniform CORE: the schedule descriptor, the
// retention policy + plan, and the inventory shape. The systemd timer/schedule
// store, routes, scrub toggle, and UI are later stages. `cadence` here is a
// PLACEHOLDER descriptor — the timer stage owns the systemd OnCalendar
// translation; it is not modelled fully yet.
//
// Retention is LEARNED from sanoid (docs/SCHEDULES-GROUND-TRUTH.md): keep-N per
// named period bucket, always keep the most recent, prune only our own
// (naming-convention-scoped) snapshots, never a held one.
// ============================================================================
