/*
 * ANAS — Scrubs view (Epic 17: story 17.5).
 *
 * The periodic-SCRUB surface — uniform across ZFS and AHR, filesystem-native
 * backend. Split from the former single "Schedules" screen: the sibling Snapshots
 * view (69-snapshots.js) owns snapshot schedules; this owns periodic scrubs. Menu
 * label "Scrubs". The guiding principle (SCHEDULES-DESIGN.md): the operator
 * enables/disables a periodic scrub on a ZFS pool and an AHR pool through IDENTICAL
 * controls; only the backend differs.
 *
 * VISIBLE DIVERGENCE (never hidden): the AHR periodic scrub runs on ANAS's OWN
 * node-level `anas-scrub.timer` (story selfheal.4) — the WHOLE two-phase scrub
 * (phase 1 md parity, then phase 2 btrfs checksums + attribution) for every
 * enabled AHR pool, one pool at a time (pools share spindles), on a monthly or
 * quarterly cadence chosen in the toolbar beside the toggle. Enabling it takes
 * md checks over from mdadm's mdcheck timers (never double-scheduled); the
 * honest notes ride the Scope column and the toggle-confirm dialog.
 *
 * SECOND VISIBLE DIVERGENCE — the "Last scrub" column. ZFS records the verdict of
 * the last completed pass and we say it in words ("repaired 0 B, 0 errors — <date>
 * (took 5h 23m)"). md records NOTHING of the kind: no completion time, no result.
 * An AHR row therefore says so out loud instead of showing an empty cell — ANAS
 * does not mine journald and does not keep a state file to manufacture a record
 * it was never given (stateless — the system is the source of truth).
 *
 * STAGE 6 — the screen becomes a console. Run now / Stop verbs and live progress:
 *   - Run now / Stop reuse the EXISTING endpoints verbatim (a second door to the
 *     same routes the Pools and Hybrid RAID views drive — no second implementation).
 *   - While a pass runs, the Last scrub cell shows it ("scrubbing — 43.0% · …")
 *     instead of going quiet: ZFS keeps ONE scan record per pool, so during a pass
 *     there IS no verdict to print.
 *   - THIRD VISIBLE DIVERGENCE — Stop is ZFS-only. `zpool scrub -s` stops a scrub;
 *     the AHR scrub is a two-phase JOB (each band's md parity check, then the
 *     btrfs checksum scrub) with no cancel path in the daemon, and this story
 *     does not build one. The AHR row's Stop is disabled with the reason in its
 *     tooltip rather than silently missing.
 *
 * Data (paths relative to /v1 — see routes/scrub.ts):
 *   GET  /scrub                → { data: [ { target:{kind,pool}, enabled,
 *                                   cadence, mechanism, note?, nextRun?,
 *                                   phases?, lastScrub: {…}|null,
 *                                   running?: {function?,percent?,speedBytesSec?,
 *                                     etaSeconds?} } ] }
 *   PUT  /scrub/zfs/:pool  {enabled}  → flip the ZFS periodic-scrub property
 *   PUT  /scrub/ahr/:pool  {enabled, cadence?}  → edit the node timer's pool
 *                                   list (cadence is node-level, optional)
 *   POST /pools/:pool/scrub {action}  → start/stop a ZFS scrub (Epic 4.12's route)
 *   POST /ahr/:pool/scrub   {}        → AHR scrub job (Epic 11's route; no stop)
 *   GET  /jobs?status=completed       → the last AHR scrub's findings (selfheal.3)
 *
 * `running` is OPTIONAL on the wire: an older daemon omits it and every row then
 * renders exactly the verdict-only cell it renders today (additive-field skew rule).
 *
 * Shared with the Snapshots view via ANAS.sched.* (69-schedules-common.js): the
 * fs-tag chip, the state pills, and the visibility-gated poll loop — one place so
 * the two views read identically and never drift.
 *
 * SELFHEAL.3 — a finished AHR scrub names WHAT is corrupt. The daemon attributes
 * each kernel scrub warning to a file and probes the named 64 KiB stripe for the
 * exact failing 4 KiB blocks; the findings ride the scrub job's RESULT. A real
 * scrub runs for hours, well past the job-poll budget of the Run now that
 * started it, so the row finds them again through the daemon's own completed-job
 * list (`GET /jobs?status=completed`, filtered here — no new endpoint): the Last
 * scrub cell of an AHR pool whose last completed scrub found something says so
 * and opens the findings window. ONE door, ONE window — no second surface.
 *
 * FOURTH VISIBLE DIVERGENCE — that job list is IN MEMORY. It holds what has run
 * since anasd started and nothing older, and ANAS keeps no scrub history of its
 * own (stateless — no shadow state, nothing persisted), so the cell says "last
 * completed scrub since the daemon started" in those words rather than implying
 * a record the system does not keep. The PVE warning notification carries the
 * same paths and is what survives a restart.
 *
 * REPAIR FROM PARITY (selfheal.6) lives in that same window and nowhere else —
 * the findings are what a repair is selected FROM, so the verb belongs where
 * they are told. Tick the files to repair (a finding with no live file under
 * the mountpoint — deleted, or inside a snapshot — cannot be ticked and says
 * why), confirm what the daemon warns about, and the job's four honest counts
 * (repaired / unrepairable / above md / not corrupt at the mapped location —
 * review R9) come back into the same window. Never automatic, never a
 * read-path heal: an operator asks for it, on named files, with named blocks.
 *
 * …and on the TOOLBAR too (selfheal.9, RULED: both, gated by need). A Repair
 * action beside Run now / Stop is the verb's standing home — the window is a
 * detail surface an operator has to be told about, the toolbar is where the
 * eye already goes for pool verbs. One enablement rule drives both doors
 * (`repairableFinding`): lit only when the selected AHR pool's last completed
 * scrub holds at least one repairable finding, greyed with the reason on the
 * button otherwise. Clicking it opens the SAME window, the repairable rows
 * already ticked — the toolbar establishes what is repairable, the operator
 * only confirms.
 *
 * REWRITE PARITY (selfheal.10) is the parity indicator's own verb. When phase 1
 * counted mismatches on a band and phase 2 named NO corrupt file, the data is
 * right and the parity is what is wrong — the one case where `mdadm
 * --action=repair` is the correct thing to run. The indicator on the Scrubs row
 * is the door: it opens a window listing the bands md counted mismatches on,
 * one band is picked (md repairs a whole array at a time), the confirm-code
 * flow states what md will do, and the result — the counter before and after,
 * and the run's own verdict — comes back into that same window. With corrupt
 * files on the same scrub the verb is greyed with the reason the daemon would
 * 409 with: rewriting parity over rot makes it permanent.
 *
 * Test hooks: view cls 'anas-view anas-view-scrubs', grid cls 'anas-grid-scrub',
 * scrub toggle 'anas-btn-scrub-toggle', run 'anas-btn-scrub-run', stop
 * 'anas-btn-scrub-stop', toolbar repair 'anas-btn-scrub-repair' (selfheal.9),
 * findings window 'anas-win-scrub-findings' with grid
 * 'anas-grid-scrub-findings' (itemId '#findingsGrid'), repair button
 * 'anas-btn-repair-parity' and result panel '#repairResult'; parity window
 * 'anas-win-scrub-parity' with grid 'anas-grid-scrub-parity' (itemId
 * '#parityGrid'), button 'anas-btn-parity-rewrite' (itemId '#rewriteParity')
 * and result panel '#parityResult'.
 *
 * Plain ES5 to match PVE's compiled ExtJS bundle — no build step, no deps.
 * Fail-open everywhere: a broken view renders an error panel, never breaks PVE.
