/**
 * Reconcile a mirror band — the verb for the decision tree's R9 root, which had
 * none (story selfheal.11, RULED 2026-09-14).
 *
 * ## The fault
 *
 * md counts DISAGREEING LEGS on a RAID1 band. It does not say which leg is
 * right, it does not say where in the band they disagree, and btrfs reads
 * through md, so the checksum pass sees whatever leg md's read-balance happened
 * to serve — which on GT-22's rig was the rotten one every time, and is not
 * contractual anywhere.
 *
 * ## Why md's own repair is not the answer, here or ever
 *
 * `mdadm --action=repair` on a mirror copies the first in-sync leg over the
 * others. It does not arbitrate; it does not look. GT-22(f) proved it in both
 * directions on the rig: with the rot on leg 0 the junk was propagated to
 * leg 1 (the band then agrees on rotten data and no later check can see it);
 * with the rot on leg 1 the good copy won. The winner is always leg 0, never
 * the right one. So the epic's ruling is absolute — NO ANAS code path issues
 * `--action=repair` on a RAID1 band. In this module that is not a convention
 * but a wrapper: every command goes through {@link mirrorGuardedExecutor},
 * which throws before the process is spawned (see {@link assertNoMdRepair}).
 *
 * ## The two arms, cheapest first
 *
 * **Arm A — scrub until clean.** GT-22's UNEXPECTED(1): an ordinary btrfs scrub
 * that MEETS the rot heals the whole band through md. btrfs re-reads on a
 * checksum failure, md serves the other leg, the good block is written back,
 * and md propagates that write to both legs — `corrected_errors: 1`, both legs
 * good afterwards. Since the read-balance is not contractual, repeating the
 * pass raises the odds that md serves the rotten leg at least once; each pass's
 * `corrected` count is progress, and a whole-band md check after each pass is
 * what says whether the band is done.
 *
 * **Arm B — compare legs, arbitrate by checksum, write through md.** When the
 * scrub cannot reach it (md never served the rotten leg), both legs are read
 * directly at their own data offsets and compared row by row. For each
 * differing 4 KiB row the md byte is mapped BACK to a btrfs logical byte
 * ({@link logicalForMdByte}) and the row is arbitrated:
 *
 *  - a DATA chunk against the csum btrfs stored for that logical byte;
 *  - a METADATA or SYSTEM chunk against the containing node's own header
 *    checksum (`verifyNode`, the same check the csum reader makes before it
 *    believes a leaf);
 *  - a row in no chunk at all is FREE SPACE — nothing knows what it should
 *    hold, and legs may disagree about it. Skipped;
 *  - a DATA row with no stored csum (NOCOW, prealloc, `nodatasum`) has nothing
 *    to arbitrate with. Skipped;
 *  - both legs failing is `unresolvedRows`: nothing is written, and the band's
 *    residual is reported rather than hidden.
 *
 * The winning row is written THROUGH md, which writes both legs — the same
 * write the repair engine makes, for the same reason.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * There is NO degraded window. The documented manual alternative — fail one
 * leg, scrub, remove, add, let md's resync copy the survivor (GT-22 b/c) — is a
 * full leg copy at ≈6–7.5 s/GiB with the array degraded throughout, which on a
 * 20 TB leg is a day and a half of single-copy exposure. This verb reads the
 * same bytes a check reads and never takes a leg out. It is never automatic,
 * never a read-path heal, and never pool-wide.
