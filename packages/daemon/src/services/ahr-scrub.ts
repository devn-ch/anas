/**
 * AHR pool scrub (Epic 11 + AHR, docs/AHR-DESIGN.md §4) — behind
 * POST /v1/ahr/:name/scrub. ONE scrub, TWO phases, strictly SEQUENTIAL and
 * never severable (story selfheal.4) — both are full-device reads and would
 * thrash each other concurrently (§4):
 *
 *   1. per-array `mdadm --action=check`, one band at a time — verifies
 *      parity/mirror consistency underneath the filesystem. Each band is waited
 *      through TWICE: first until md has actually STARTED the check
 *      (`sync_action`, or /proc/mdstat), then until it is idle again. A band
 *      whose check counted parity mismatches (`/sys/block/<md>/md/mismatch_cnt`
 *      > 0, read once the check has run AND gone idle) warns immediately: rot
 *      exists, and phase 2 is what names the files. A band md never started is
 *      said so and its counter — which belongs to an earlier check — is not
 *      read at all; a band whose check FINISHED before the first poll is
 *      recognised from `last_sync_action` TOGETHER WITH a `mismatch_cnt` that
 *      moved (md zeroes the counter at a sync start — `last_sync_action` is
 *      persistent and proves nothing on its own), and only then is its counter
 *      the verdict; and a band md froze, or took a resync/recover/reshape on
 *      instead, has this scrub's check CANCELLED (`--action=idle`, so it
 *      cannot fire beside the next band's) and is recorded as not checked —
 *      the scrub moves to the next band rather than spinning.
 *   2. btrfs scrub (start + poll `btrfs scrub status`) — checksums the
 *      filesystem's view of the data — then the ATTRIBUTION pass (story
 *      selfheal.3) names the corrupt files and their failing 4 KiB blocks.
 *
 * The attribution's probe reads are tiny, but they are still reads of the
 * array: §4's rule is that nothing else reads while a check runs, and running
 * it after phase 1 keeps that true (it used to sit between the phases when the
 * order was reversed). The manual Scrub button and the periodic timer run this
 * same code path — one job, one order.
 *
 * `btrfs scrub status` text is parsed minimally (Status / Bytes scrubbed % /
 * Error summary): like /proc/mdstat it has no structured alternative on the
 * shipped btrfs-progs, so it joins GT-13's sanctioned text exceptions.
 *
 * Findings notify at `warning` via PVE (§7.2); a clean scrub is silent —
 * healthy/idle shows nothing (dashboard policy §7.3).

/**
 * `Error summary: csum=2` says how many, never which. The kernel does say
 * which — every scrub error is logged with the file's subvolume id, inode and
 * byte offset (GT-3):
 *
 *   BTRFS warning (device dm-0): scrub: checksum error at logical 14811136 on
 *   dev /dev/mapper/gtsh-data, physical 14811136 root 256 inode 257 offset
 *   1179648 length 4096 links 1 (path: f1.bin)
 *
 * The journal ENVELOPE is JSON (`journalctl -k -o json`); the MESSAGE inside it
 * is not, and the kernel offers no structured form of it — so this text parse
 * joins `btrfs scrub status` above as a sanctioned Principle-13 exception, for
 * the same reason.
 *
 * Two drill facts shape the rest:
 *   - the reported `offset` is the 64 KiB btrfs STRIPE start, not the failing
 *     4 KiB block, and the line carries no csum values (GT-3) — so the exact
 *     block is evidence ANAS gathers itself, by reading each of the 16 blocks
 *     in the stripe with O_DIRECT (a read error = a bad block);
 *   - `root N` is a subvolume id, so the printed path is subvolume-relative
 *     and names nothing on the node until `btrfs inspect-internal
 *     subvolid-resolve` turns the id into a name (GT-3/GT-6).
 *
 * A third fact shapes the compressed case (selfheal.8, live-proven twice):
 * when the failing extent is COMPRESSED the printed `offset` is extent-
 * relative — `0` for a corrupt extent starting 128 KiB into the file — and the
 * named logical is the 64 KiB stripe the failing blob sits in, not the blob
 * itself (two corrupt blobs 16 KiB apart were both reported at their stripe's
 * start). The kernel does not say which extent inside the stripe it was, so
 * the engine's mapping answers: the extents owning the stripe, resolved from
 * the extent tree's backrefs, and their real file ranges probed whole.

 * a COMPRESSED one is probed over its real file range (selfheal.8: the
 * kernel's `offset` is extent-relative there, so the printed offset points at
 * the wrong 64 KiB). Where every extent in the stripe is uncompressed the
 * kernel's offset IS the file offset (GT-3) and the plain 16-block probe is
 * exact.
 *
 * When the extents CANNOT be resolved, the stripe is STILL probed at the
 * kernel's printed offset (second-pass review F6). The earlier cut dropped the
 * probe, on the reasoning that a compressed extent's printed offset is
 * extent-relative (selfheal.8) and names the wrong 64 KiB. Half of that is
 * right and the conclusion was not: a probe reads the FILE with O_DIRECT, so a
 * block that comes back EIO is a block of this file that genuinely cannot be
 * read, whichever extent it belongs to. The wrong window can only cost a MISS,
 * never a false accusation — and the kernel's offset is EXACT for an
 * uncompressed extent (GT-3), which is the common case. Dropping it voided the
 * whole pool's findings whenever the mapping was unavailable for any reason.
 *
 * So the rule is: probe what the kernel named; report the blocks that failed;
 * and when nothing in that window failed AND the mapping was not available to
 * say where else to look, report `unidentified` with the reason rather than an
 * empty `badBlocks` that reads as "nothing wrong here". A resolved COMPRESSED
 * extent still bypasses the printed offset entirely and is probed over its real
 * file range, which is strictly better than either.
 *
 * And the window says so about ITSELF (T7, third pass). A probe made with the
 * mapping down sets `probedUnverified` on the finding, and the `reason` is kept
 * even when blocks WERE found — the blocks named are real, the list of them is
 * not known to be complete. The findings window and the notification belong to
 * another owner; what they should render off this pair is: blocks listed, plus
 * a plain line that the search window could not be verified and why, so a
 * repair offered on those blocks is not read as a repair of the whole file.
