/**
 * Rewrite parity — the one case ANAS can prove safe to hand to `md repair`
 * (story selfheal.10, RULED 2026-09-14).
 *
 * ## What this is, and why it is the exception
 *
 * The epic's standing rule is "never run md repair": md counts mismatching
 * stripes, it does not say WHICH member is wrong, and `repair` resolves that by
 * recomputing parity from the data members — so on a DATA-member rot it rewrites
 * parity to match the junk, the array goes clean, and the rot is invisible to
 * every future check while btrfs still EIOs the block (GT-18's negative control,
 * verbatim: `parity row == XOR(data rows): True` with the file unreadable).
 *
 * GT-18's positive half is the other side of the same coin: with the data
 * INTACT and the parity member rotten, a bounded `mdadm --action=repair` fixes
 * parity, leaves the data alone, and the stripe re-checks at
 * `mismatch_cnt = 0`. The two cases are indistinguishable TO MD. They are
 * distinguishable to ANAS, and the proof is the two-phase scrub: phase 1 counted
 * mismatches on this band, phase 2's checksum pass came back clean across the
 * whole pool. Every file that btrfs can vouch for is right, so what md would
 * recompute parity FROM is right, so the thing that is wrong is the parity.
 *
 * That proof is this verb's entire licence, which is why it is re-taken twice —
 * once at submit, once again immediately before the md write — and why a FRESH
 * btrfs scrub runs first, in this job, on this pool: the evidence scrub may be
 * hours old, and a finding that arrived since would be blessed.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * It is never automatic, never a read-path heal, and never pool-wide: one band,
 * asked for by an operator through the confirm gate, with that band's own
 * duration estimate in front of them. It writes no file. It moves no md knob
 * that md itself does not move — both phases are whole-band operations with
 * `sync_max` at `max`, so neither needs a window and nothing needs to be
 * narrowed or ended. And it touches no array whose current operation is not
 * ours: a member that fails mid-run puts md into `recover`, and the only correct
 * thing this run can do then is walk away with every knob exactly as md left it
 * (design review D2, `selfheal-syncop.ts`).

 * be rebuilt at 600 MiB per member to get a 7-second window at all. None of

 * real AHR pool is: there the op runs at the slowest member's sequential rate,
 * shared with whatever else the pool is serving and capped by md's own
 * `speed_limit_max`.
 *
 * So the estimate does not extrapolate from the rigs. It assumes a deliberate
 * FLOOR — 60 MiB/s per member, comfortably below a modern 7200 rpm disk's
 * sequential rate — so the number the operator confirms is a ceiling on the
 * wait rather than an optimistic guess. The warning says the assumption out

 * Rewrite one band's parity: fresh btrfs scrub → `mdadm --action=repair` over
 * the whole band → md `check` over the whole band → `mismatch_cnt` must read 0.
 *
 * The repair is issued on the BAND, not on a stripe: md counts mismatches, it
 * does not locate them, so the only honest scope for "the parity of this band
 * is wrong somewhere" is the band. That is what the confirm gate's duration
 * estimate is about, and why this is a per-band verb rather than a per-pool one.
