/**
 * The node-level AHR periodic-scrub UNITS (story selfheal.4) — the
 * snapshot-schedule unit pattern applied to the whole two-phase scrub: ONE
 * `anas-scrub.service` + `anas-scrub.timer` pair per NODE (not per pool). The
 * unit files ARE the store: the canonical AhrScrubSchedule JSON
 * (`{ kind: 'ahr-scrub', cadence, pools: [...] }`) is embedded as an
 * `X-ANAS-Schedule=` comment — the SINGLE source of truth parsed back, never
 * reverse-engineered from ExecStart. There is no second config file and no
 * custom scheduler (the standing scheduling ruling).
 *
 * The .service fires the compiled runner beside dist/snapshot-task.js
 * (dist/scrub-task.js), which POSTs `/ahr/<pool>/scrub` for each pool in the
 * list IN SEQUENCE — AHR pools on one node share spindles, so pools never scrub
 * concurrently. `Persistent=true` catches a fire missed across a reboot.
 *
 * Per-pool toggles rewrite this one pair (add/remove the pool from the list);
 * the cadence is node-level, so setting it from any pool rewrites the one
 * timer. When the pool list empties, both units are removed. A unit file
 * without our marker is never overwritten — parse-or-skip, and a WRITE that
 * would land on such a file is REFUSED (`foreign-unit`), not merely skipped
 * (review R10): the store reads before it writes, the way the snapshot store's
 * parser already reads before it adopts.

 * error rethrows. The timer's enablement is restored with the files (third
 * pass): `enable --now` enables BEFORE it starts, so a failed start on a first
 * write leaves the `timers.target.wants` symlink dangling over a file the
 * rollback removes — the disable takes it back down; a restored previous pair is
 * re-enabled when the timer was enabled before the write (`is-enabled` is read
 * up front), and DISABLED again when it was not — on a rewrite of a disabled
 * timer the write's own `enable --now` armed it, and the rollback must take it
 * back down (fourth pass). A ForeignUnitError passes through untouched —
