/**
 * Ownership of an md sync operation — the ONE place that decides whether ANAS
 * may write `idle` to an array's `sync_action` (design review 2026-09-14, D2).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `echo idle > sync_action` and `mdadm --action=idle` do not mean "cancel the
 * check I asked for". They mean "stop whatever md is doing", and md is very
 * often doing something else: a member that failed while a repair or a scrub
 * was walking the pool puts the array straight into `recover`, rebuilding onto
 * a spare. Three code paths used to write `idle` on sight — the bounded check's
 * poll loop, the knob restore, and the scrub's band cancel — and every one of
 * them would ABORT that rebuild. The periodic scrub would do it on every pass.
 *
 * So the rule, in one function: re-read `sync_action` IMMEDIATELY before any
 * write of `idle`, and write only when it reads `check` AND this daemon is the
 * one that issued a check on that array and has not yet ended it. Anything
 * else — a resync, a recovery, a reshape, a repair, a frozen array, a check
 * somebody else started, or an attribute that cannot be read at all — is a
 * FOREIGN operation: the knob is left exactly as it is and the caller records
 * one sentence saying so.
 *
 * The same rule covers `sync_min` / `sync_max`: narrowing the window under a
 * running recovery, or widening it back mid-rebuild, is the same interference
 * with the same array.
 *
 * ## Why the issue log is not shadow state (Principle 11)
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted and nothing here is consulted as a fact about the
 * system — `sync_action` is always re-read from the kernel, and it is the
 * authority. The set records only what THIS process did in THIS run, which is
 * the one thing sysfs cannot tell us: md reports `check`, never "check, asked
 * for by anasd". After a restart the set is empty, which is the honest answer —
 * and then every op reads as foreign and nothing is interrupted, which is the
 * safe direction to fail.
