/**
 * ANAS must never spin up a sleeping disk on its own: the identity cache runs
 * smartctl with `-n standby`, and a standby skip (disk was asleep, nothing was
 * read) must keep the LAST MEASURED identity — reported marked `standby` +
 * `stale` — instead of turning the disk's health into `unknown`. A disk never
 * seen awake is reported as `standby` with no health claim. A standby reading
 * is never a cache hit: the disk may wake at any time, so the next pass
 * retries.
 *
 * A probe FAILURE is not a measurement either: it keeps the disk's last known
 * reading and re-probes — one transient failure must not blank the identity
 * for the daemon's lifetime or end the re-probes. Re-probes are BOUNDED,
 * though: each consecutive failure doubles the delay (1, 2, 4, … passes,
 * capped at 8), so a disk that fails forever is not probed on every pass.
 * `stale` ("last known, not current") is only ever reported OVER A REAL
 * MEASURED READING — a never-measured disk whose probe fails is the plain
 * unknown, unmarked.
 *
 * Crucially, the failure must be classified FROM THE DOCUMENT, not from a
 * parse error: smartctl --json emits a VALID document on an open failure
 * (exit bit 1, a severity 'error' message, no device fields), and the
 * executor RESOLVES on a non-zero exit — so the document reaches the parser
 * as a "successful" read. A "measured" identity built from it is all null,
 * and caching that as a hit would blank the disk and never probe it again.
