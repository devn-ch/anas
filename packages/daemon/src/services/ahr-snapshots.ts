 * AHR btrfs subvolume snapshots (story 11.12, docs/AHR-DESIGN.md §12).
 *
 * Layout: new pools carry `@data` (mounted at the pool mountpoint via
 * `subvol=@data`) and `@snapshots` (OUTSIDE the mounted tree). Because
 * snapshots live outside `@data`, they never nest into the data, and rollback
 * is a subvolume SWAP that destroys nothing.
 *
 * Operations that touch `@snapshots`/`@data` mount the filesystem TOP-LEVEL
 * (`subvolid=5`) on demand at a private runtime path and unmount after EVERY
 * op — nothing new stays mounted (a mount → op → finally-unmount pattern).
 * Listing is the exception: `btrfs subvolume list` enumerates the WHOLE
 * filesystem from any path in it, so it reads the live `@data` mount directly
 * with no extra mount.
 *
 * Sizes are absent everywhere — per-snapshot usage needs btrfs qgroups, OUT of
 * v1 (§12): no number beats a wrong/unlabeled one.
