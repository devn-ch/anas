/**
 * Periodic SCRUB — uniform surface, filesystem-native backend (Epic 17.5 +
 * story selfheal.4, docs/SCHEDULES-DESIGN.md §Scrub). The operator sees one
 * "periodic scrub: on/off" control for a ZFS pool and an AHR pool; each flips
 * its own backend:
 *
 *   | fs  | read state            | mechanism                                   |
 *   |-----|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
 *   | ZFS | org.debian:periodic-scrub property (GT-2) | PVE's monthly cron, per-pool-gated |
 *   | AHR | anas-scrub.service marker + timer is-enabled | ANAS's node-level two-phase scrub timer |
 *   | AHR | (no ANAS units, mdcheck on) | mdadm's mdcheck timers — the LEGACY state, read-only |
 *
 * ZFS: the property gates PVE's 2nd-Sunday monthly cron. `-`/unset, `auto`,
 * `enable` all SCRUB (default = on); only `disable` turns it off. ANAS sets
 * `enable`/`disable` — a surgical property write, never a config/unit edit, and
 * never touches the (disabled) systemd `zfs-scrub-*@.timer` so no collision (GT-4).
 *
 * AHR (selfheal.4): the periodic AHR scrub is the WHOLE two-phase scrub —
 * phase 1 md parity per band, then phase 2 btrfs checksums + attribution — run
 * by ONE node-level `anas-scrub.timer` (services/scrub-schedule-units.ts) whose
 * embedded schedule lists the enabled pools. Enabling a pool adds it to that
 * list AND disables mdadm's mdcheck timers (ANAS owns md checks on the node —
 * never double-scheduled); disabling the last pool removes the units and puts
 * mdcheck BACK ON (ruling 2026-09-14): with no ANAS scrub left the node is
 * stock again, and the stock node has those timers enabled. The `cadence` is
 * node-level: monthly (1st Sunday 03:00) or quarterly.
 *
 * The per-pool toggle is the ONLY thing that writes units and disables mdcheck
 * (review F1/F4): ANAS never adopts mdcheck's schedule on its own. A node where
 * mdcheck is enabled and no ANAS units exist is the LEGACY state — 0.3.1's
 * mdcheck-based toggle, or simply the stock node — and `readAhrScrubState`
 * reports it honestly: `enabled:false`, `mechanism:'mdcheck-timer'`, with a
 * note saying what is running and what enabling ANAS's scrub would do. Nothing
 * is armed and nothing is switched off at daemon start.
