/**
 * The two seams `iscsi.6` had to cover but could not exercise, because the code
 * they guard DOES NOT EXIST YET — story `iscsi.6`, clause 2.
 *
 * The story names two operations ZFS lets through silently that ANAS must
 * refuse under a LUN:
 *
 *   - a dataset/volume **RENAME**. `zfs rename` under a live LUN returns exit 0,
 *     the LUN keeps serving from the already-open bdev, `udev_path` becomes a
 *     dangling path, and the NEXT BOOT RESTORE silently drops the LUN (GT-40).
 *     ANAS exposes no rename endpoint today, so there is nothing to gate — and
 *     that absence is exactly what has to be pinned, or the day one is added it
 *     will be added without the gate.
 *   - **removal of a backing image file** "wherever ANAS deletes files under a
 *     dataset". A survey of the daemon says there is no such path: the only
 *     `unlink` calls are systemd unit files under the systemd directory, plus
 *     the iSCSI LUN's OWN `?destroyBacking` delete, which is the deliberate
 *     verb, not a collision. That absence is pinned here too.
 *
 * Both tests are FAILURE ALARMS for a future change, not proofs of behaviour.
