# AHR self-heal — the fault-rooted decision tree

What the self-heal arc (`selfheal.1`–`.10`) actually does, read from the FAULT
down rather than from the code out. Twenty-four roots — the things that can go
wrong on an AHR pool — and, under each, every action the system takes, every
decision it makes on a result, every refusal, every notification, every UI
state and every stated residual, in the order the system meets them.

The tree itself is `test/self-heal/decision-tree.yaml`. It is machine-checked by
`test/self-heal/check-decision-tree.mjs`, which rides `npm run test:unit`
through `packages/daemon/src/__tests__/selfheal-decision-tree.test.ts` and is
runnable by hand:

```
node test/self-heal/check-decision-tree.mjs
```

§Coverage and §The trees below are GENERATED from that YAML by
`test/self-heal/render-trees.mjs` — the drawings were hand-kept until the
seventh pass, which is how the same node came to carry two different
truncations of its label in two places. Change the YAML, then:

```
node test/self-heal/render-trees.mjs          # rewrite the two sections
node test/self-heal/render-trees.mjs --check  # …or just say they are stale
```

The `--check` form rides the same unit test as the structural check, so the
drawing cannot drift from its data again. Everything else in this file — the
header, §How to read it and §Findings — is written by hand.

The check is structural where a drawing can lie — a dangling edge, a cycle, a
root that reaches no terminal leaf, a `code:` naming a function that no longer
exists, a `test:` naming a case that no longer exists — and a REPORT where the
answer is a judgment: missing leaves, orphans and mis-applied actions are
counted and listed, never asserted. Those are §Findings below.

## How to read it

Every leaf carries three references, because a leaf with none of them is a
claim rather than a fact:

- `code:` — `<path>:<symbol>`, the thing that implements it, or `—`
- `test:` — the unit/route/harness test or the loop-suite case id that proves
  it (`suite:<id>`), or `—`
- `gt:` — the ground-truth verdict it rests on (`docs/AHR-SELF-HEAL-GROUND-TRUTH.md`), or `—`

Shapes:

| shape | kind | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `{ … }` | decision | a predicate on a result |
| `[ … ]` | action | something the system does — the function is named |
| `( … )` | refusal | a refusal, with its reason code or its sentence |
| `[/ … /]` | notification | a PVE notification, with its wording anchor |
| `[[ … ]]` | ui | a UI state or affordance |
| `> … ]` | residual | a documented limit — the system stops here on purpose |

**The tree is fault-rooted, not a flowchart.** A shared decision node carries
only its CONTINUE edge; a branch that characterises a particular fault is
linked from THAT fault's root. So "which roots reach this leaf" has a real
answer, and the tree's `exclusive_actions` block can state which answers are
allowed:

| action | may be reached from | why |
|---|---|---|
| `md-action-repair` | R1 only | GT-18: bounded `mdadm --action=repair` rewrites parity correctly when the data is intact and BLESSES the rot when it is not; on a mirror it copies the first in-sync leg over the others without looking at which is right (N1) |
| `md-block-write` | R2, R3, R5, R6, R9, R15, R16, R19, R23 | GT-7/GT-8: a block goes through md only after a reconstruction matched the checksum btrfs stored for it |
| `restore-from-backup-advice` | R1, R3, R4, R6, R7, R9, R10, R11, R14, R16 | selfheal.7 F2 / D10: "restore this file from backup" is advice to OVERWRITE the file, so it may only be reached from a fault where nothing below the checksum tree can prove the block right |
| `not-corrupt-here-advice` | R18 only | the mapping-abort sentence asserts a positive fact — the bytes at the mapped location were READ and still PASS their stored checksum |

All four come back clean, which they did not before the seventh pass.

`md-action-repair` was already clean: the mirror root (R9) stops at
`not-a-parity-band` and the member-failure root (R10) at `array-busy`, which is
what N1 and GT-18 require.

`not-corrupt-here-advice` is now R18 only. It used to be reachable from R16 and
R22 as well, because every mapping failure became the `mapping-abort` bucket —
whose sentence says the bytes at the mapped location still pass their stored
checksum. That is true of the one case the re-verify establishes it for and of
nothing else, so those blocks moved to the `not-examined` bucket (F3).

`restore-from-backup-advice` changed on both sides. R22 came OFF the list: a
read-back-guard failure establishes nothing at all about the file, so it is
`not-examined` too (F9). Four faults went ON it, each through one named leaf
where the block genuinely cannot be proven — R1 through `E12d` (written, and it
fails its cold re-read), R4 and R9 through `E04f2` (both mirror legs fail and
disagree with each other), R11 through `E07a` (md has recorded bad blocks over
the row and can reconstruct nothing from that member). The list is longer and
every entry on it is a fault where a restore is the only action left.

| `E12e` | decision | the post-check reads `mismatch_cnt = 0` over a row the DIRECT member read still faults: md's stale view of our OWN write, never a clean parity group. `staleCache: true` is recorded and the block takes the same cold proof a counted residual takes; the advice is the re-scrub that produces a count Rewrite parity's evidence gate will accept | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:directParityConsistent` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:is not a clean pass: the block is proven cold and the residual is reported` | `GT-23` |

| leaf | kind | what the system does | `code:` | `test:` | `gt:` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `X5` | decision | a metadata node fails its own crc32c — the csum tree leaf that would arbitrate the data block is itself rotten | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:verifyNode` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-csum.test.ts:refuses one flipped byte anywhere past the header csum` | `GT-20` |
| `E04b` | decision | the csum leaf must pass its OWN node checksum (crc32c of bytes 32…nodesize, and its own bytenr): a failed copy 0 falls back to the DUP chunk's second copy | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:readStoredCsum` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-csum.test.ts:falls back to the DUP chunk's SECOND copy when the first has rotted` | `GT-20` |
| `E04c` | refusal | both DUP copies fail: CsumUnreadableError with reason code `csum-unreadable` — nothing is known about the data block, and the words "restore from backup" are deliberately absent | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:CsumUnreadableError` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-csum.test.ts:REFUSES a csum leaf that fails its own node checksum, on both DUP copies` | `GT-20` |
| `S46` | action | path-less errors (`unable to fixup`, read/super) counted as `unattributed`, deduped against the logicals already attributed | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:parseUnattributedScrubError` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-scrub.test.ts:errors with no path are counted unattributed — and never counted twice` | `GT-3` |
| `X5c` | action | the kernel's `read error corrected` lines are counted in the two windows ANAS already reads (selfheal.12 — never a watcher): the scrub's journal window and a repair job's own window, both filtered to the pool's dm device, and the count plus the member devices ride the result as `metadataCorrected {count, devices}` | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:readCorrectedReads` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-scrub.test.ts:a clean scrub that corrected metadata says so — result and notification` | `GT-20` |
| `X5r` | residual | a DUP metadata rot is repaired by the RW MOUNT's read path, not by the scrub: `btrfs scrub` reports 0 corrected, and the only durable evidence is a one-time kernel `read error corrected` line — which is exactly what ANAS now counts in the windows it already reads (selfheal.12), so the residual is the SENTENCE, not silence | — | — | `GT-20` |
| `E05a` | action | evictStripeCache: shrink `stripe_cache_size` to its floor of 17, sweep ±200 stripes while it is small, restore — without it a check over a recently touched stripe reads the CACHE and reports 0 over junk. On kernel 7.0.14-17 it no longer reaches a stripe written MOMENTS ago (GT-23), which is why the verdict no longer rests on its number alone | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:memberDataSectors` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:sweeps the stripes around a target near the END of the array` | `GT-14` |
| `J42` | refusal | `csum-unreadable`: re-scrub after the metadata is repaired (a btrfs scrub repairs metadata copies), and explicitly do NOT restore | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-repair.ts:CSUM_UNREADABLE_SENTENCE` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:a csum-unreadable unrepairable block is told to re-scrub, not restore (D10)` | `GT-20` |

| `X5n` | notification | ONE sentence on the notification the run already earns: "btrfs corrected N metadata read(s) from the mirror copy during this run. A member is returning bad metadata. Check that disk's SMART data in Disks." — and a CLEAN scrub whose only signal is this count earns its own warning, because the summary says nothing (GT-20) | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:metadataCorrectedSentence` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-scrub.test.ts:the sentence rides the EXISTING notification when the scrub already found errors` | `GT-20` |
| `E05a2` | action | directParityConsistent: every member's row read O_DIRECT off the MEMBER devices at its own data offset and the parity group recomputed - XOR of the data rows against P, the Q syndrome against Q on RAID6, the legs against each other on RAID1. md's cache takes no part in it, which is the whole point (GT-23) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:directParityConsistent` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:diagnoses ABOVE MD when P and Q both agree with the bad data` | `GT-23` |

| `E05` | decision | precheck: a bounded md `check` over the TARGET stripe and its `mismatch_cnt`, weighed against the direct member-row computation - parityAgreement names the pair, and the verdict needs both | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:parityAgreement` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:names each of the four combinations` | `GT-5` |
| `J51` | notification | ONE PVE notification: `info` when every block repaired, `warning` otherwise, with the per-file advice and the file list capped at 20 | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-repair.ts:repairBody` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:everything repaired notifies at info and says so` | — |
| `S64` | ui | the Scrubs row: the findings link, the amber parity indicator and the muted skipped-band count share ONE cell, each with its own tooltip | `packages/pve-integration/src/69-scrubs.js:renderLastScrub` | `packages/pve-integration/test/dialog-contracts.harness.mjs:scrubs: the row says how many files, labelled` | — |
| `E06` | action | `rmw_level = 0` on the TARGET's band for the write window — at the default, a correct block written through md updates parity against the JUNK (GT-7) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:sets rmw_level to 0 BEFORE the write — the GT-7 poison is the default` | `GT-7` |
| `J52` | ui | the outcome is rendered back into the window the request was made from — per-file verdicts on their own rows, and the four counts | `packages/pve-integration/src/69-scrubs.js:showRepairResult` | `packages/pve-integration/test/dialog-contracts.harness.mjs:repair: the result appears in the window the request was made from` | — |
| `E07` | decision | reconstructionPlan: `degraded` re-read and each role's `rd<n>/state` consulted, so a member md KICKED since the gates is never read for its stale bytes | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:reconstructionPlan` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:keeps the syndrome that does not need the kicked member, and only that one` | — |
| `E07r5` | action | RAID5: the one candidate is the XOR of the same stripe row on every other member | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:reconstruct` | `suite:2-neg` | `GT-8` |
| `E08` | decision | arbitrate: crc32c of each candidate against the stored csum, best first — the btrfs checksum is what decides, never md | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:crc32c` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:reconstructs it, arbitrates against the stored csum and writes it back` | `GT-11` |
| `E09` | decision | read-back guard: the md offset about to be written must hold the bytes read from the member (on RAID1, the bytes of SOME leg — md serves a mirror read from either) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:readBackGuard` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:passes when md served the HEALTHY leg (R5: not a failed mapping)` | — |
| `E10` | decision | pre-write re-check at the LAST instant: `degraded`, `sync_action` and `reshape_position` re-read, because a bounded check over a 20 TB band takes minutes | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:preWriteRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:writes NOTHING when a recovery starts between the precheck and the write` | `GT-19` |
| `E11` | action | write: ONE 4 KiB block, O_DIRECT + fsync, THROUGH md — and only after the reconstruction matched the checksum btrfs stored for it **[md-block-write]** | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `suite:7-member` | `GT-8` |
| `E12` | decision | postcheck: the same evicted bounded check must now read `mismatch_cnt = 0` AND the same direct member-row computation must agree - the stripe was written through md moments ago, which is exactly the state its check answers from the cache in (GT-23) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:boundedWindowCheck` | `suite:7-bcheck` | `GT-8` |
| `E13` | decision | cold read through the FRESH pin snapshot (drop_caches first; the whole logical extent when compressed) — a warm page of the live file answers from memory and hides everything | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:coldRead` | `suite:3-cold` | `GT-9` |
| `E14` | action | cleanup in `finally`, PER BAND and only the bands this run touched: rmw_level, then the sync window under the ownership rule, then stripe_cache_size, then destroy the pin | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:restoreSyncKnobs` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:restores rmw_level on the band it turned it down on — and leaves the other band alone` | `GT-13` |
| `E15` | decision | outcome `repaired`, with the mapping, the steps and the stored csum as its audit trail | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:produces an outcome the shared schema accepts` | `GT-8` |

A band the pool does not have is a 400 that lists the bands it does, before any confirm code is minted | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:mirrorReconcileArray` | `packages/daemon/src/routes/__tests__/ahr-mutate.test.ts:400 on a body that names no band, and on a band the pool does not have` | — |
| `M01` | decision | ARM A, "scrub until clean" (GT-22 UNEXPECTED(1)): an ordinary btrfs scrub that MEETS the rot heals the whole band through md - btrfs re-reads on a csum failure, md serves the other leg, and md propagates the write-back to BOTH legs. The pass is repeated up to three times because md's read-balance is not contractual, with a whole-band md check after each | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:reconcileMirrorBand` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:stops at the first pass whose check reads 0 — the scrub healed the band through md` | `GT-22` |
| `M10` | refusal | `not-a-mirror-band`: a parity band's mismatch is parity disagreeing with the data, and it has a verb of its own (Rewrite parity). Not a state that passes - it never becomes true for that band. The pair with `not-a-parity-band` is what carries the epic's invariant at both doors | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:parityBandRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:refuses a PARITY band outright — it never becomes a mirror` | `GT-18` |
| `M12` | refusal | `array-busy` / `job-active`: degraded, mid-sync, sync window still bounded (GT-13's trap - the whole-band check is this run's only proof), or another scrub/repair/rewrite/reconcile in flight. Every one of them re-taken immediately before arm B writes anything | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:mirrorReconcileArrayRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:refuses a degraded band, a busy one, and one whose sync window is still bounded` | `GT-17` |
| `M13` | refusal | md's own `repair` is refused BEFORE the process is spawned, on every door of the executor this verb uses - `exec`, `pipeline` and `execToStream` alike (GT-22(f): on a mirror it copies leg 0 blindly, and junk on leg 0 was propagated to leg 1 on the rig). The ruling is absolute, so this is a wrapper and not a convention: there is no way past it | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:mirrorGuardedExecutor` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:the guarded executor never lets one through, on any of its three doors` | `GT-22` |
| `M15` | ui | the result, in the window the request was made from: which ARM answered, the counts before and after, the rows nothing could arbitrate, and - on anything but `reconciled` - that the band is NOT clean and md repair is still the wrong thing to reach for. The notification says the same, once | `packages/pve-integration/src/69-scrubs.js:showMirrorResult` | `packages/pve-integration/test/dialog-contracts.harness.mjs:the ARM that answered is named — arm A is the ordinary scrub healing it` | — |
| `M17` | ui | the confirm gate states both arms and their cost, that a row with no checksum is LEFT EXACTLY AS IT IS, that a row neither leg satisfies is never written, that the pool stays ONLINE and undegraded throughout (the whole difference from doing it by hand with mdadm), and that md's own repair is not used and must not be run by hand either | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:mirrorReconcileWarnings` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:names both arms, what is left alone, and the absence of a degraded window` | `GT-22` |

| `U08` | ui | with corrupt files on the same scrub the verb is dark carrying the daemon's own 409 sentence, and the handler refuses a click anyway | `packages/pve-integration/src/69-scrubs.js:parityRewriteBlocked` | `packages/pve-integration/test/dialog-contracts.harness.mjs:rewrite: the handler itself refuses, not just the disabled state` | `GT-18` |
| `E05a2` | action | directParityConsistent: every member's row read O_DIRECT off the MEMBER devices at its own data offset and the parity group recomputed - XOR of the data rows against P, the Q syndrome against Q on RAID6, the legs against each other on RAID1. md's cache takes no part in it, which is the whole point (GT-23) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:directParityConsistent` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:diagnoses ABOVE MD when P and Q both agree with the bad data` | `GT-23` |
| `J43` | decision | the `above-md` bucket: "parity already agreed with the bad data — this implicates something other than the disks (memory, controller, software)", which stays an implication | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-repair.ts:ABOVE_MD_SENTENCE` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:anything unrepairable or above md notifies at warning, in the epic's words` | `GT-6` |
| `J50` | action | AhrRepairResultSchema.parse: repaired / unrepairable / aboveMd / mappingAbort / notExamined, always summing to the blocks attempted | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-repair.ts:repairAhrFiles` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:the notification names all five counts, and they add up (review R9, seventh pass F3)` | — |
| `M01b` | decision | a pass's progress is read from the breakdown `btrfs scrub status` prints under its error summary: `Corrected` is how many blocks the scrub healed through md this time round, and `Uncorrectable` is the count that means no copy can satisfy a checksum. A clean pass prints no breakdown and both read zero | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:parseScrubErrorCounts` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:reads the breakdown btrfs prints under its error summary` | `GT-22` |
| `M14` | refusal | md took an operation of its own while a whole-band check was running (a leg failing puts it into `recover`): the run walks away with every knob exactly as md left it, and reports `residual` with `foreign-sync-op`. Same waiter, same ownership rule as the parity rewrite - one place decides | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-parity-rewrite.ts:waitForOwnSyncOp` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:walks away when md takes an operation of its own mid-check` | `GT-13` |
| `M12b` | refusal | `bad-blocks-present`: a leg with recorded md bad-block ranges serves EIO for them and holds no correct copy, so a row inside one cannot be read off that leg at all - and arm B's whole method is reading both legs. Replace the member first; not a wait-and-retry state | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:mirrorBadBlocksRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:refuses a band with recorded md bad blocks — md holds no correct copy there` | — |
| `M13b` | refusal | the guard itself THROWS rather than warning: a run that reached this point has a bug in ANAS, and the correct outcome of that bug is a failed job - never a blessed rot. The suite asserts the same invariant on the RUN instead of on the source: md announces `md: repair of RAID array mdN` when it takes one, and no case-9 row may find that line | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:assertNoMdRepair` | `suite:9-neg-no-md-repair` | `GT-22` |
| `S40` | action | phase 2/2: `btrfs scrub start` polled to finished — one pass, two callers (the scrub and the parity rewrite) | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:btrfsScrubPass` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-scrub.test.ts:runs btrfs scrub to completion, THEN per-array checks sequentially` | `GT-3` |
| `E05` | decision | precheck: a bounded md `check` over the TARGET stripe and its `mismatch_cnt`, weighed against the direct member-row computation - parityAgreement names the pair, and the verdict needs both | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:parityAgreement` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:names each of the four combinations` | `GT-5` |
| `J51` | notification | ONE PVE notification: `info` when every block repaired, `warning` otherwise, with the per-file advice and the file list capped at 20 | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-repair.ts:repairBody` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:everything repaired notifies at info and says so` | — |
| `M02` | action | a pass's whole-band check reads `mismatch_cnt = 0`: the legs agree again and the run stops there. `arm: scrub`, one row per pass with its `corrected` count - the cheapest arm, and the one that costs no leg read at all | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:btrfsScrubPass` | `suite:9a-reconcile` | `GT-22` |
| `M03` | decision | a pass corrects NOTHING while md still counts: md is not serving the rotten leg to btrfs, so repeating the same coin flip proves nothing. Arm A stops at once and arm B takes over - this is the residual case the story names | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:reconcileMirrorBand` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:a pass that corrects NOTHING while md still counts stops arm A at once` | `GT-22` |
| `M11` | notification | a scrub pass reported UNCORRECTABLE errors: the files are NAMED and the run CARRIES ON. This is the one place the mirror verb's gates differ from Rewrite parity's - that verb aborts on any finding because md repair would bless the rot, and this one writes no row it cannot prove. A file no copy can satisfy is a fact to report (and its rows come back as `unresolvedRows`), not a reason to leave the rest of the band mismatched. The notification is a `warning` even when the band itself comes out clean | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:reconcileMirrorBand` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:NAMES an uncorrectable file and carries on — it is a fact to report, not a refusal` | `GT-22` |
| `S42` | decision | Error summary clean: no ATTRIBUTION is read and nothing is probed — the journal is read once more for the corrected-metadata count alone (selfheal.12), the one rot signal a clean scrub can hold | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:parseBtrfsScrubStatus` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-scrub.test.ts:a clean scrub probes nothing, and reads the journal only for the corrected-metadata window` | `GT-3` |
| `E06` | action | `rmw_level = 0` on the TARGET's band for the write window — at the default, a correct block written through md updates parity against the JUNK (GT-7) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:sets rmw_level to 0 BEFORE the write — the GT-7 poison is the default` | `GT-7` |
| `J52` | ui | the outcome is rendered back into the window the request was made from — per-file verdicts on their own rows, and the four counts | `packages/pve-integration/src/69-scrubs.js:showRepairResult` | `packages/pve-integration/test/dialog-contracts.harness.mjs:repair: the result appears in the window the request was made from` | — |
| `M04` | action | ARM B, "compare legs": both legs are read IN FULL with O_DIRECT at each leg's OWN data offset (`rd<n>/offset` may differ) and compared in 4 KiB rows. Same IO as a check, and NO degraded window - no leg is failed, removed or re-added at any point | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:memberOffsetOn` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:reads both legs in windows and still decides every row — the result parses as the shared schema` | `GT-16` |
| `S60` | action | AhrScrubResultSchema.parse — validated at the daemon boundary before it leaves as a job result | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-scrub.ts:scrubAhrPool` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-scrub.test.ts:the new record fields round-trip the shared schema — and stay optional` | — |
| `E07` | decision | reconstructionPlan: `degraded` re-read and each role's `rd<n>/state` consulted, so a member md KICKED since the gates is never read for its stale bytes | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:reconstructionPlan` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:keeps the syndrome that does not need the kicked member, and only that one` | — |
| `M04b` | action | the WHOLE chunk tree is read once, in one dump. The forward chain walks it by key because it starts from a logical byte; arm B starts from an md byte and nothing in the tree is keyed by device offset, so there is no walk to make. Affordable where the csum tree is not: a chunk covers a gigabyte | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:readAllChunkItems` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:arbitrates a rotten DATA row by its stored checksum and writes the winner through md` | `GT-2` |
| `S64` | ui | the Scrubs row: the findings link, the amber parity indicator and the muted skipped-band count share ONE cell, each with its own tooltip | `packages/pve-integration/src/69-scrubs.js:renderLastScrub` | `packages/pve-integration/test/dialog-contracts.harness.mjs:scrubs: the row says how many files, labelled` | — |
| `E07r5` | action | RAID5: the one candidate is the XOR of the same stripe row on every other member | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:reconstruct` | `suite:2-neg` | `GT-8` |
| `M05` | decision | each DIFFERING row is mapped BACK up the chain - md byte to LV byte through the dm segment, LV byte to btrfs logical through the covering chunk's own delta (the GT-2 hop, inverted; a DUP metadata chunk's second copy answers too, and says which copy it is). The chunk's TYPE then says which authority arbitrates the row | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:logicalForMdByte` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:is the exact inverse of the forward hop, dm offset and chunk delta included` | `GT-2` |
| `E08` | decision | arbitrate: crc32c of each candidate against the stored csum, best first — the btrfs checksum is what decides, never md | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:crc32c` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:reconstructs it, arbitrates against the stored csum and writes it back` | `GT-11` |
| `M06` | action | DATA chunk: the csum btrfs stored for that logical byte arbitrates. crc32c each leg's row, and the leg that matches WINS - its bytes are written THROUGH md, which writes both legs. The same write the repair engine makes, for the same reason **[md-block-write]** | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:readStoredCsum` | `suite:9b-compare` | `GT-7` |
| `M07` | action | METADATA or SYSTEM chunk: btrfs stores no EXTENT_CSUM for a tree block - the checksum is in the node's own header, over its own bytes. The containing 16 KiB node is read off each leg and checked the way btrfs checks it; the leg whose copy vouches for itself wins. The verdict is cached per node (a node is four rows) **[md-block-write]** | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:verifyNode` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:a METADATA row is decided by the node's own header checksum` | `GT-20` |
| `M08` | refusal | nothing can arbitrate the row, and it is LEFT EXACTLY AS IT IS: a row in no chunk at all is free space (btrfs has never written there, and legs may disagree about it), and a DATA row with no stored csum is a NOCOW file, a prealloc range or `nodatasum`. Counted as `freeSpaceRows` / `uncheckedRows` and reported, never guessed at | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:reconcileMirrorBand` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:counts rows in no chunk as free space and leaves them exactly as they are` | — |
| `M09` | refusal | BOTH legs fail the row's checksum (or both pass while holding different bytes): `unresolvedRows`, nothing written, outcome `residual`. Neither copy is the file, so the file needs restoring from backup - and the band's leftover mismatch is reported rather than hidden **[restore-from-backup-advice]** | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:reconcileMirrorBand` | `suite:9-neg` | `GT-22` |
| `M16` | residual | arm B decided every row it could and the verifying whole-band check STILL counts: `residual`, never `reconciled`. The rows with no checksum are named as the likely remainder, because they are the ones this verb deliberately did not touch | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-mirror-reconcile.ts:reconcileMirrorBand` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-mirror-reconcile.test.ts:a band that comes back still mismatched is a residual, never a success` | `GT-22` |
| `E09` | decision | read-back guard: the md offset about to be written must hold the bytes read from the member (on RAID1, the bytes of SOME leg — md serves a mirror read from either) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:readBackGuard` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:passes when md served the HEALTHY leg (R5: not a failed mapping)` | — |
| `E10` | decision | pre-write re-check at the LAST instant: `degraded`, `sync_action` and `reshape_position` re-read, because a bounded check over a 20 TB band takes minutes | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:preWriteRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:writes NOTHING when a recovery starts between the precheck and the write` | `GT-19` |
| `E11` | action | write: ONE 4 KiB block, O_DIRECT + fsync, THROUGH md — and only after the reconstruction matched the checksum btrfs stored for it **[md-block-write]** | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `suite:7-member` | `GT-8` |
| `E12` | decision | postcheck: the same evicted bounded check must now read `mismatch_cnt = 0` AND the same direct member-row computation must agree - the stripe was written through md moments ago, which is exactly the state its check answers from the cache in (GT-23) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:boundedWindowCheck` | `suite:7-bcheck` | `GT-8` |
| `E13` | decision | cold read through the FRESH pin snapshot (drop_caches first; the whole logical extent when compressed) — a warm page of the live file answers from memory and hides everything | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:coldRead` | `suite:3-cold` | `GT-9` |
| `E14` | action | cleanup in `finally`, PER BAND and only the bands this run touched: rmw_level, then the sync window under the ownership rule, then stripe_cache_size, then destroy the pin | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:restoreSyncKnobs` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:restores rmw_level on the band it turned it down on — and leaves the other band alone` | `GT-13` |
| `E15` | decision | outcome `repaired`, with the mapping, the steps and the stored csum as its audit trail | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:produces an outcome the shared schema accepts` | `GT-8` |

| `H5` | action | the md geometry reads each member's bad-block list (`md/rd<n>/bad_blocks` - the kernel's own symlink to `dev-<name>`), one range per line, matched in that member's own data coordinates. An UNREADABLE list is null and is not the same as an empty one | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:parseBadBlocks` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-map.test.ts:parses one range per line, ignoring anything that is not two numbers` | — |

| `J46` | refusal | a LUN image whose unrepairable blocks are ALL `csum-unreadable` gets NO restore verb at all: the LUN identity rides the csum-unreadable sentence (N5) | `packages/daemon/src/services/ahr-repair.ts:csumUnreadableLunSentence` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:a LUN image whose unrepairable blocks are ALL csum-unreadable is NOT told to restore (N5)` | `GT-20` |
| `E03a` | decision | a SelfhealMapError anywhere in the chain carries the REASON the chain stopped (`inline-extent`, `hole`, `owner-scan-truncated`, `band-unreadable`, `unresolvable`): the block was NOT examined, and the mapping-abort sentence asserts the opposite | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:SelfhealMapError` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-map.test.ts:every map failure carries its reason (F3)` | — |
| `RT10` | refusal | `lun-session-active`: a repair path backing a LUN with a LIVE initiator session is 409ed BEFORE a confirm code exists. The block is proven and btrfs's copy-on-write leaves the old extent alone, but the initiator holds its own cache and has no idea the bytes moved - log it out first | `packages/daemon/src/routes/ahr-mutate.ts:lunSessionRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/routes/__tests__/ahr-repair.test.ts:409 lun-session-active BEFORE a confirm code exists` | — |

| `E03b` | refusal | an INLINE extent or a HOLE: there is no on-disk location at all. A hole is reachable on any ANAS-created LUN, every image of which is created sparse with ftruncate, and says nothing whatever about the LUN's data | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:resolveBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:a HOLE: not-examined / hole` | — |

| `RT11` | ui | Rewrite parity DISCLOSES instead of refusing: it reads every member of the band twice and writes parity, never a file, so nothing it writes is visible to a guest - but the operator is agreeing to hours of that under a live disk | `packages/daemon/src/routes/ahr-mutate.ts:rewriteLunWarnings` | `packages/daemon/src/routes/__tests__/ahr-mutate.test.ts:names the LUN and its live sessions, and says the guest sees nothing this run writes` | — |

| `E03` | decision | resolve, AFTER the pin: file block → EXTENT_DATA → the COVERING chunk's own delta → the dm linear segment → member and offset from md geometry read live | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-map.ts:resolveBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-map.test.ts:derives the block's repair unit and its logical byte from the tree, not from filefrag` | `GT-2` |

| `E05a` | action | evictStripeCache: shrink `stripe_cache_size` to its floor of 17, sweep ±200 stripes while it is small, restore — without it a check over a recently touched stripe reads the CACHE and reports 0 over junk. On kernel 7.0.14-17 it no longer reaches a stripe written MOMENTS ago (GT-23), which is why the verdict no longer rests on its number alone | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:memberDataSectors` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:sweeps the stripes around a target near the END of the array` | `GT-14` |
| `E05a2` | action | directParityConsistent: every member's row read O_DIRECT off the MEMBER devices at its own data offset and the parity group recomputed - XOR of the data rows against P, the Q syndrome against Q on RAID6, the legs against each other on RAID1. md's cache takes no part in it, which is the whole point (GT-23) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:directParityConsistent` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:diagnoses ABOVE MD when P and Q both agree with the bad data` | `GT-23` |

| `E06` | action | `rmw_level = 0` on the TARGET's band for the write window — at the default, a correct block written through md updates parity against the JUNK (GT-7) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:sets rmw_level to 0 BEFORE the write — the GT-7 poison is the default` | `GT-7` |
| `E07` | decision | reconstructionPlan: `degraded` re-read and each role's `rd<n>/state` consulted, so a member md KICKED since the gates is never read for its stale bytes | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:reconstructionPlan` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:keeps the syndrome that does not need the kicked member, and only that one` | — |
| `E07r5` | action | RAID5: the one candidate is the XOR of the same stripe row on every other member | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:reconstruct` | `suite:2-neg` | `GT-8` |
| `E08` | decision | arbitrate: crc32c of each candidate against the stored csum, best first — the btrfs checksum is what decides, never md | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-csum.ts:crc32c` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:reconstructs it, arbitrates against the stored csum and writes it back` | `GT-11` |
| `E09` | decision | read-back guard: the md offset about to be written must hold the bytes read from the member (on RAID1, the bytes of SOME leg — md serves a mirror read from either) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:readBackGuard` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:passes when md served the HEALTHY leg (R5: not a failed mapping)` | — |
| `E10` | decision | pre-write re-check at the LAST instant: `degraded`, `sync_action` and `reshape_position` re-read, because a bounded check over a 20 TB band takes minutes | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:preWriteRefusal` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:writes NOTHING when a recovery starts between the precheck and the write` | `GT-19` |
| `E11` | action | write: ONE 4 KiB block, O_DIRECT + fsync, THROUGH md — and only after the reconstruction matched the checksum btrfs stored for it **[md-block-write]** | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` | `suite:7-member` | `GT-8` |
| `E12` | decision | postcheck: the same evicted bounded check must now read `mismatch_cnt = 0` AND the same direct member-row computation must agree - the stripe was written through md moments ago, which is exactly the state its check answers from the cache in (GT-23) | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:boundedWindowCheck` | `suite:7-bcheck` | `GT-8` |
| `E13` | decision | cold read through the FRESH pin snapshot (drop_caches first; the whole logical extent when compressed) — a warm page of the live file answers from memory and hides everything | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:coldRead` | `suite:3-cold` | `GT-9` |
| `E14` | action | cleanup in `finally`, PER BAND and only the bands this run touched: rmw_level, then the sync window under the ownership rule, then stripe_cache_size, then destroy the pin | `packages/daemon/src/services/selfheal-repair.ts:restoreSyncKnobs` | `packages/daemon/src/services/__tests__/selfheal-repair.test.ts:restores rmw_level on the band it turned it down on — and leaves the other band alone` | `GT-13` |

## Findings

Ranked lose-data > false-assurance > operational. Each names the concrete
scenario and what would close it. The two that prompted this exercise — the
parity-only-rot gap (D1) and the RAID1 md-repair mis-application (N1) — are both
shipped; these are the next ones of the same shape.

### Lose-data

**F1 — R9 · a RAID1 band mismatch that phase 2 cannot attribute has NO reachable
verb.** *(leaf `X9r`, `test: —`; the missing half of N1.)*
Phase 1 issues `mdadm --action=check` on a mirror band like any other and counts
`mismatch_cnt > 0`. Phase 2 finds nothing, and it cannot: btrfs reads through
md, md serves the read from whichever leg `read_balance` picks, and if that is
the healthy leg every checksum passes. So the scrub fires the PARITY-ONLY
notification, the Scrubs row shows the amber indicator, and its tooltip says a
mirror's legs "are arbitrated per block by Repair from parity". That verb takes
`{ files: [{ path, blocks }] }` and is lit only by `repairableFinding`, which
requires at least one named block — and phase 2 named none. The toolbar button
is greyed ("no scrub findings for this pool since the daemon started"), the
findings window has no rows, and Rewrite parity is correctly refused
(`not-a-parity-band`). The band keeps a rotten leg until the good leg fails, at
which point md serves the rot. This is the shape D1 closed for parity bands: a
stated fact, a promised remedy, and no way to reach it.
**Closes it:** a per-band mirror verb that walks the band's stripes, reads BOTH
legs directly and arbitrates each disagreement against the csum tree — every
piece already exists (`memberOffsetOn`, `readStoredCsum`, `crc32c`, the mirror
branch of `reconstruct`, `readMemberWithRetry`). Minimum honest fix: stop the
tooltip naming a verb the operator cannot reach.
**CLOSED (seventh pass), half of it.** The half that was a lie went first: the
Scrubs row tooltip, the Rewrite-parity button reason and the parity window
stopped naming a verb the operator cannot reach (leaf `X9r`, harness-checked).

**CLOSED IN FULL (2026-09-15, story `selfheal.11`).** R9 has its verb —
`POST /v1/ahr/:name/mirror-reconcile`, beside Rewrite parity in the same window,
need-gated on the band's level so exactly one of the two is ever lit. Arm A
repeats the ordinary scrub, which GT-22 proved heals the band through md when
md's read-balance serves the rotten leg; arm B reads both legs in full and
arbitrates every differing row against the checksum btrfs stored for it — the
csum tree for DATA, the node's own header checksum for METADATA and SYSTEM —
writing only the leg that matches, THROUGH md. Rows nothing can vouch for are
counted and left exactly as they are. The `md-action-repair` action is
unreachable from R9 by construction: every command the service issues goes
through a guard that throws on `--action=repair` before the process is spawned,
and the suite's case-9 rows assert the same thing against the kernel's own log.
The root went from 39 nodes / 7 terminal leaves to 62 / 20, all of them carrying
code AND a test.

**F2 — R1 · a repair that WROTE a proven-correct block is reported
`unrepairable` and told to restore from backup.** *(leaf `E12a`, mis-applied
`restore-from-backup-advice`, `test: —`.)*
RAID6 with rot in the target block AND in the Q member: the P-XOR candidate wins
arbitration, the read-back guard passes, the pre-write re-check passes, and
`writeDirect` puts the reconstructed block through md. It is now provably
correct — it matched the checksum btrfs stored for it. The post-check's bounded
check then still counts a mismatch, because Q is still wrong, and
`selfheal-repair.ts:repairBlock` fails the block with *"the block was written
back but the bounded md check over stripe N still reports mismatch_cnt=… — the
parity group is not consistent. Restore `<file>` from backup."* The operator is
told to overwrite a file that was just repaired, which is how a restore from an
older backup loses data that was recoverable. And the residual — parity rot on
that band — is recorded nowhere: it is not in the scrub's `parityMismatches`, so
Rewrite parity refuses with `no-parity-mismatch` until a fresh multi-hour
two-phase scrub has run.
**Closes it:** a non-zero post-check AFTER a successful write is a different
verdict from one before it. Report the block `repaired` with a
parity-inconsistent qualifier, carry the band into a parity-mismatch record, and
point at Rewrite parity — never at a restore.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** A non-zero post-check AFTER a write is now a
different question: the block is re-read COLD — through the pin, where btrfs
verifies its stored checksum on the read — and arbitrated again (`coldVerify`,
leaf `E12a`). If it passes, the outcome is `repaired` carrying a
`parityResidual { array, band, bandIndex, mismatchCnt }` and the sentence "the
block is repaired; the band still has a parity/Q mismatch — run Rewrite parity"
(`E12c`). The repair job rolls those up into `AhrRepairResult.parityResiduals`
in the SAME row shape a scrub's `parityMismatches` uses (`J54`), the Scrubs
parity indicator reads the newer of the pool's last scrub and its last repair
(`U02r`), and `parityRewriteEvidence` accepts a repair-job source (`P01r`) — so
the residual is actionable without a fresh multi-hour two-phase scrub. Only a
block that fails its cold re-read as well is `unrepairable`, and only that leaf
(`E12d`) carries restore advice.

### False assurance

**F3 — R16 / R22 · a block whose MAPPING failed is reported "not corrupt here —
nothing needs a restore".** *(leaf `E03a`, mis-applied `not-corrupt-here-advice`,
`test: —`.)*
`repairBlock`'s catch turns ANY `SelfhealMapError` into the `mapping-abort`
bucket. That bucket's sentence — `ahr-repair.ts:MAPPING_ABORT_SENTENCE` in the
notification, and the same words in the findings window — asserts a positive
fact: *"the bytes on the member still pass their stored checksum, so there was
nothing to reconstruct … Nothing was written, and they need no restore."* True of
the one case `reverify` establishes it for. False of every map failure: an inline
extent, a HOLE (`resolveBlock` refuses `diskByte === 0` by name, and
`iscsi-mutate.ts:createSparseImage` creates every LUN image with `ftruncate`, so
this is reachable on any ANAS-created LUN), an owner scan truncated at
`MAX_OWNER_LEAVES`, a band whose geometry went unreadable mid-run. Those blocks
were never examined at all, and they may be genuinely corrupt.
**Closes it:** separate the two. A `reasonCode` on `mapping-abort` — or a fifth
count — telling "not corrupt at the mapped location" from "the location could not
be determined", each with its own sentence.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** `SelfhealMapError` now carries a `reasonCode`
(`inline-extent` | `hole` | `owner-scan-truncated` | `band-unreadable` |
`unresolvable`), set at each throw site, and the engine turns it into a new
outcome kind: `not-examined`. `mapping-abort` keeps its meaning for the ONE case
that establishes it — the re-verify READ the block and it passed. The repair job
counts `notExamined` in its own bucket, the arithmetic is
`repaired + unrepairable + aboveMd + mappingAbort + notExamined === blocks`
everywhere, and the per-file advice is "this block could not be examined:
&lt;reason&gt;; nothing was written; re-scrub after &lt;what would change&gt;"
— never "they need no restore".

**F4 — R4 · on a RAID1 band, rot that arrived THROUGH md is reported "restore
from backup" instead of "above md".** *(leaf `E04f`, mis-applied
`restore-from-backup-advice`, `test: —`.)*
On a parity band, through-md rot reaches the precheck, `mismatch_cnt` reads 0
(GT-6) and the outcome is `above-md` carrying the sentence that matters: *"parity
already agreed with the bad data — this implicates something other than the disks
(memory, controller, software)."* On a mirror the same fault puts the same bad
bytes on both legs, so `reverify` aborts before the precheck ever runs: *"every
mirror leg fails the stored csum … there is no good copy left. Restore from
backup."* The remedy happens to be the same; the DIAGNOSIS is not. `aboveMd`
stays 0, the notification never says it, and a node with failing memory keeps
corrupting. Parallel construction: the same fault must read the same way on both
band types.
**Closes it:** when every leg fails, run the precheck anyway and take the
`above-md` verdict when the mirror's own bounded check counts 0.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** On a mirror, every leg failing the stored csum no
longer aborts before the pre-check. The bounded check runs first, because a
mirror check compares the legs with each other: `mismatch_cnt == 0` means the
legs AGREE and are both wrong, which is `above-md` in the same words a parity
band gets (leaf `E04f1`); `> 0` means they disagree and neither matches, which
is `unrepairable` (`E04f2`). Parallel construction holds — one fault, one
reading, on both band types.

**F5 — R10 / R14 · an outcome that says "nothing written" after the block was
written.** *(leaf `E12b`, `test: —`.)*
`boundedWindowCheck` raises `ForeignSyncOpError` whenever md has taken an
operation of its own — including from the POST-check, which runs after
`writeDirect`. `repairBlock`'s single global catch answers every one of them with
*"array state changed mid-repair: …, nothing written"*. A member failing inside
the post-check window (minutes on a 20 TB band) therefore produces an outcome
whose central factual claim is false, in the bucket that then advises a restore.
**Closes it:** a flag set at the write step; the post-write catch says the block
was written and the array changed under the verification.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** A `written` flag is set the moment `writeDirect`
returns, and the catch words the outcome from it: *"the block was written and
matches its checksum; the post-check could not run (md started &lt;op&gt;) —
re-scrub to confirm parity"*, reported `repaired` with a `postcheckSkipped`
note (leaves `E12b`/`J53`). "Nothing written" is now only ever said about a run
that wrote nothing.

**F6 — R5 · a DUP metadata correction leaves ANAS no signal at all.** *(leaf
`X5r`, `code: —`, `test: —`, GT-20.)*
GT-20 proved the repair of a rotten metadata copy happens in the RW MOUNT's read
path, and that a later `btrfs scrub` reports `corrected_errors: 0`. The only
durable evidence is the one-time dmesg pair `checksum verify failed on logical
<bytenr> mirror 1 …` / `read error corrected: ino 0 off <bytenr>`, and the
attribution parses neither — `parseScrubWarning` matches only `scrub: checksum
error …`, `parseUnattributedScrubError` only `unable to fixup`, read and super
errors. A disk quietly eating metadata reads as a clean pool.
**Closes it:** one more pattern over the SAME journal window the attribution
already reads, reported as a corrected-metadata count rather than as a finding.

**F7 — R21 · `systemctl preset` re-enables the mdcheck timers ANAS turned off,
and ANAS neither prevents nor notices it.** *(leaf `T12`, `code: —`, `test: —`,
GT-21.)*
GT-21 is explicit: an apt reinstall leaves admin-disabled timers alone, but
`systemctl preset` — or a `preset-all` after a systemd upgrade — enables both,
because they carry no preset exemption and the node's two preset files have no
catch-all. The node then runs mdcheck's ten days of 6-hour windows on the same
spindles as the ANAS scrub, and because `runningAhrCheck` is node-wide, every
periodic scrub, every Repair and every Rewrite parity answers 409 for the
duration. The `note` says "double parity check — mdcheck is on" to whoever opens
the Scrubs screen; the timer's runner records failures and moves on. GT-21's own
verdict says it: *"if the timers must stay off, they need an explicit
preset/disable, not just `is-enabled`."*
**Closes it:** ship a preset fragment (`disable mdcheck_start.timer`, `disable
mdcheck_continue.timer`) alongside the units while ANAS owns md checks, removed
with them — the same surgical, reversible shape as the units themselves.

**F8 — R11 · the md bad-block list exists only in the shell hook.** *(leaf `H5`,
`code: —`, `test: —`.)*
`packaging/anas-md-event.sh:count_bad_block_ranges` reads
`/sys/block/<md>/md/dev-*/bad_blocks` once, at `RebuildFinished`, and says *"N
unreadable sector range(s) … data in those ranges could not be reconstructed"*.
Nothing in the daemon reads it — not the pool state, not the scrub result, not
`arrayRefusal`, not `preWriteRefusal`, not `parityRewriteArrayRefusal`. A band
with recorded BBL entries is a band md cannot fully reconstruct from, and Rewrite
parity would hand it a whole-band `mdadm --action=repair` regardless.
**Closes it:** read the same file where the topology is built, surface it as a
band-level fact on the Hybrid RAID view, and refuse Rewrite parity on a band
whose BBL is non-empty.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** The md geometry reads each member's
`bad_blocks` (`md/rd<n>/bad_blocks` — the kernel's own symlink to
`dev-<name>`), one range per line, matched in that member's own data
coordinates; an UNREADABLE list is `null` and is deliberately not the same as an
empty one (leaf `H5`). Rewrite parity refuses a band with any non-empty list
(`bad-blocks-present`, `H6`), and the repair engine treats a member with a range
over the target ROW as absent — RAID5 then has nothing left, RAID6 still has the
other syndrome (`H7`).

**F9 — R22 · a read-back guard failure advises a restore.** *(leaf `E09a` →
`J40`, mis-applied `restore-from-backup-advice`.)*
The guard fires precisely when "the mapping and the array disagree" — when
nothing about this file has been established at all. The block lands in
`unrepairable` and the per-file advice is "restore this file from backup". Same
shape as F3, one step further down the sequence, and it wants the same fix.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** The guard's failure is `not-examined` with reason
code `unresolvable` and the sentence "the mapping and the array disagree;
nothing was written, and nothing is known about this file's bytes" (leaf
`E09a`). R22 no longer reaches restore advice at all.

### Operational

**F10 — R16 · neither Repair nor Rewrite parity is `held-by-lun`-aware.** *(leaf
`RT10`, `test: —`.)*
`routes/ahr-mutate.ts:ahrHeldByLunConflict` is in the same file and hard-409s a
pool DESTROY while a LUN is served from it. The repair route neither refuses nor
discloses it, and the parity-rewrite confirm gate — which asks the operator to
agree to hours of whole-band reading — never mentions that a guest's disk is live
on the pool. `ahr-repair.ts` already calls `heldByLunOnce`, but only after the
fact, to word the advice.
**Closes it:** a disclosure line in both confirm gates. Not a hard refusal — a
repair writes a block it has proven correct, which is the opposite of unsafe.
**CLOSED (seventh pass), asymmetrically — because the two verbs write
different things.** Repair now consults `heldByLun` up front, before a confirm
code is minted, and a path backing a LUN with an ACTIVE initiator session is a
409 `lun-session-active` (leaf `RT10`): the block is proven and btrfs's
copy-on-write leaves the old extent alone, but the initiator holds its own cache
and has no idea the bytes moved, so it is logged out first. Rewrite parity WARNS
instead (`RT11`) — a band-level read patrol and a parity write, with no file
byte touched — and the operator weighs the hours of reading under a live disk.

**F11 — R18 · repair identity is the path, not the inode.** *(leaf `X18r`,
`test: —`.)*
A scrub finding carries `inode` and `subvolume`; `AhrRepairRequest` carries
`{ path, blocks }`. A path deleted and re-created between scrub and repair is
caught by `reverify` ("not corrupt here") and by nothing else. That is safe, and
it is the whole reason `reverify` exists — but it is a residual worth stating
rather than an invariant anyone checks.
**Closes it:** carry the finding's inode and subvolume into the request and refuse
a mismatch by name.
**CLOSED (seventh pass).** `AhrRepairFile` gained an optional `inode`, the
findings window sends it (`U09`), and the engine `stat`s the path at the gates —
before anything is pinned — and refuses a mismatch by name: `inode-changed`, in
the `not-examined` bucket, with "the file at this path is not the file the scrub
examined" (leaves `X18r`/`E00b`).

**F12 — 6 leaves with `test: —`**, down from 15. `X5r`, `X13`, `X13b`, `E04e`,
`E08b`, `T12`. Nine of the fifteen closed with F1–F5 and F8–F11 above; `E13b`
picked up the test the F2 work gave it (the cold read still erroring after a
write is exactly what separates a parity residual from an unprovable block).
What is left is F6 (`X5r`) and F7 (`T12`), which this pass did not touch, plus
selfheal.5's documented not-covered paths — `E04e` (more than one bad on-disk
sector inside one compressed blob), `X13`/`X13b` (power loss inside the write
window) — and `E08b`, the crc32c collision, which is untestable by construction.

**F13 — 54 orphan exported actions** (exported functions of the named services
that no leaf references). Still 54 after the seventh pass, which added five
exports (`parseBadBlocks`, `memberHasBadBlock`, `bandBadBlocks`,
`badBlocksRefusal`, `repairParityResiduals`) and referenced four of them from
leaves — `bandBadBlocks` joined group (b), and four helpers the new leaves name
left it. Three groups, only the third worth acting on:

- *(a) out of scope by design, 11.* The ZFS half of `scrub-schedules.ts`
  (`parseZfsScrubEnabled`, `zfsScrubGetArgs`, `zfsScrubSetArgs`,
  `readZfsScrubState`, `setZfsScrubEnabled`) plus `ahrScrubRunning`,
  `parseIsEnabled`, `parseMdcheckEnabled`, `isEnabledArgs`, `mismatchCntArgs`,
  `mdcheckToggleArgs`. ZFS scrubbing is not this arc.
- *(b) reached transitively, 40.* Parsers and placement helpers a named function
  calls: `parseChunkItems`, `chunkForLogical`, `logicalToLvByte`,
  `parseExtentItems`, `extentForFileOffset`, `parseExtentTreeItems`,
  `placeMdByte`, `stripeDataOrder`, `readMdGeometry`, `parseMdDetailExport`,
  `geometryFromAttributes`, `btrfsDeviceFor`, `coveringChunk`, `locateLogicalIn`,
  `subvolumeIdOf`, `chunkStripeOffsets`, `segmentForLvByte`, `selfhealBand`,
  `csumHex`, `parseCsumItems`, `findCsumEntry`, `csumFromLeafBytes`, `gfMul`,
  `gfPow2`, `gfInv`, `SelfhealRunError`, `syncActionArgs`, `lastSyncActionArgs`,
  `kernelJournalMessages`, `countErrorSummary`, `journalSince`,
  `approximateDuration`, `scrubCadenceToOnCalendar`, `renderScrubServiceUnit`,
  `parseScrubServiceUnit`, `readScrubSchedule`, `readScrubTimerNext`,
  `writeScrubUnits`, `parseRunnerArgs`, `isIdleSyncAction`. Each has its own unit
  test; none is a decision an operator ever sees.
- *(c) worth a second look, 3.* `selfheal-syncop.ts:hasIssuedCheck` has no caller
  outside its own module's `ownsSyncOp` and its tests — the ownership question is
  asked one way only, which is the design, but the export widens a surface whose
  whole point is that exactly one place decides. `forgetIssuedChecks` is a test
  hook on a production module. `scrub-task.ts:main` is the CLI entry.

### Invariants that came back clean

- `md-action-repair` is reachable from R1 and no other root. The mirror band (R9)
  terminates at `not-a-parity-band` and the member-failure root (R10) at
  `array-busy` — N1 and GT-18 hold.
- `not-corrupt-here-advice` is reachable from R18 and no other root, and
  `restore-from-backup-advice` only from faults where nothing below the checksum
  tree can prove the block right. Both were violated before the seventh pass;
  mis-applied actions now count 0.
- Every one of the 24 roots reaches at least one terminal leaf: there is no fault
  in this list the system meets with nothing at all.
- No orphan nodes: every leaf in the tree is reachable from a fault.
- Every `code:` and every `test:` reference resolves against the tree at
  `02d9fe3`, and again at the seventh pass.
